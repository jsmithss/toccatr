## Intro

Toccatr to do list

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)

library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE) 
library(janitor, quietly = TRUE) 
library(plotly, quietly = TRUE)
source("//10.0.3.251/Projects/Lab reference/Settings and Scientific Reference/slackrs/core_scripts/neuromuscular_function_1_6.r")

```


Need to add prismy_time for timecourse data and prismy_group for grouped format prism data

Create function for pairing multiple evaluations from same dataset side by side  
Either use pivot wider or: split, rename variables by eval (use index not actual eval num), join by platename_well

# Assuming your dataframe is called 'iris'
Filtereing for platemap
first_species <- iris[1, "Species"]  # Get the species of the first row
filtered_df <- iris %>%
  filter(Species == first_species)  # Select rows with the same species
  select compound and row col, 
  unique(0)
