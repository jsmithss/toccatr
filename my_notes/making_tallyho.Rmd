Add clipfromxl to functions
Need to add prismy and plate centering to functions and remove generic ones
Work out if tubemap list can be added to a function

# Assuming your dataframe is called 'iris'
Filtereing for platemap
first_species <- iris[1, "Species"]  # Get the species of the first row
filtered_df <- iris %>%
  filter(Species == first_species)  # Select rows with the same species
  select compound and row col, 
  unique(0)
